This library has a collection of metric files which can be used with GSL to solve geodesic equations.  

The file solve_geodesics.cc implements the rkp8d (dormand prince method) to solve the geodesic equations for 
an infalling observer.  Feel free to take or modify this code for whichever purposes you require.

To compile you need to have gsl installed and type the command

gcc -static solve_geodesics.cc -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm

or

gcc solve_geodesics.cc -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm

depending on your gsl installation.
