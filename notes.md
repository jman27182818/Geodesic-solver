# Notes and TODO's




## TODO:

1.) Program the formulas for the inverses explicitly for dimensions below some number.  This would make computing the inverse matrix trivial for dimensions below a certain number.  Above a certain number use a linear algebra package.


2.) find a linear algebra package.


3.) Figure out what to do with the metric derivative.  Finite difference schemes seem like a bad idea but might be the only option.
